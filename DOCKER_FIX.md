# Docker Build Fix

## Issue
The Docker build was failing with the error:
```
error: command 'gcc' failed: No such file or directory
```

This occurred because the `timezonefinder` package (and potentially other packages) require C compilation tools to build native extensions, but the Python slim image doesn't include build tools by default.

## Solution
Updated the Dockerfile to include necessary build dependencies:

```dockerfile
# Install system dependencies including build tools
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gcc \
    g++ \
    curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

## What Was Added
- **gcc**: GNU C compiler for building C extensions
- **g++**: GNU C++ compiler for building C++ extensions  
- **curl**: For health checks and potential API calls
- **Cleanup**: Removed apt lists to reduce image size

## Verification
The build now completes successfully and the container runs properly:
- ✅ Docker build completes without errors
- ✅ Container starts and shows as "healthy"
- ✅ Application responds correctly on port 8087
- ✅ All dependencies install properly

## Additional Optimizations (Optional)

### Multi-stage Build (for production)
If you want to optimize the image size further, you could use a multi-stage build:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM python:3.9-slim as builder

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gcc \
    g++ \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --user -r requirements.txt

# Runtime stage
FROM python:3.9-slim

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local
COPY . .

ENV PATH=/root/.local/bin:$PATH
EXPOSE 8087

CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8087", "--workers", "2", "--threads", "2", "--timeout", "30", "--access-logfile", "-", "--error-logfile", "-", "wsgi:app"]
```

### .dockerignore Optimization
Consider adding a `.dockerignore` file to reduce build context:

```
__pycache__
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.Python
env
pip-log.txt
pip-delete-this-directory.txt
.tox
.coverage
.coverage.*
.cache
nosetests.xml
coverage.xml
*.cover
*.log
.git
.mypy_cache
.pytest_cache
.hypothesis
.DS_Store
```

## Current Status
✅ **Fixed**: Docker build now works correctly
✅ **Tested**: Container runs and responds properly
✅ **Optimized**: Includes necessary build tools
✅ **Ready**: Application is ready for deployment

The ham radio conditions application with all the enhanced propagation prediction improvements is now successfully containerized and ready to run!
